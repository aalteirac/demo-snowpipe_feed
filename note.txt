install docker with apt install docker
install python
pip install docker-compose, require sudo to run, need a fix


export jar, delete it BEFORE

on the raps for testing node you need nodejs 18 and npm and 

curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt install nodejs
sudo apt install npm
sudo apt install libudev-dev

SUPER IMPORTANT on the rasp:
sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/ant-usb-m.rules
SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0fcf", ATTRS{idProduct}=="1009", RUN+="/sbin/modprobe usbserial vendor=0x0fcf product=0x1009", MODE="0666", OWNER="pi", GROUP="root"
1009 and 0fcf are based on vendor usb, get them from lsusb command on the rasp

Seems node 18 is the image to go for usb node lib. with devices on ttyUSB0 (need to ensure ANT stick is always mounted on this one)
